# OpenKey

OpenKey is a continuation of Keene Enterprises' CACKey Chrome plugin.

CACKey provides US Department of Defense Common Access Card (CAC) and US NIST SP 800-73 Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card support.

The original source code can be found here: http://cackey.rkeene.org.

## Purpose

The intent of OpenKey is to provide a Google Chrome middleware plugin that, as before, registers client certificates from hardware keys with Google for authentication.

Additionally, OpenKey provides an interface that allows Javascript in a webpage or extension to perform RSA cryptography operations.

The wishlist for this app is shown below:

- List Certificates
- Provision RSA 2048 Certificate with varying capabilities
- RSA 2048 OAEP Encryption
- RSA 2048 OAEP Decryption
- RSA 2048 SHA1 Signing
- RSA 2048 SHA1 Verifying

## Installation

This plugin will be available on the Chrome Web Store. It is likely only to operate in ChromeOS.
